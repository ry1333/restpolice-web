        </div>

        <section class="policy-section">
          <h2>Getting Started</h2>
          <p><strong>How do I use SetLock?</strong></p>
          <p>Open SetLock on your Apple Watch, then tap "Set Done" after completing a set. The rest timer starts automatically. When it hits zero, selected apps on your iPhone are blocked until you tap "Set Done" again to start your next set.</p>

          <p><strong>Do I need an Apple Watch?</strong></p>
          <p>The Watch is the primary way to control the timer hands-free while training. The iPhone app handles app blocking, history, and settings. You can also log sets from the iPhone if you don't have a Watch.</p>

          <p><strong>Does SetLock work without an internet connection?</strong></p>
          <p>Yes. All core features — timer, app blocking, workout logging — work fully offline. Cloud sync (for backing up your history across devices) requires an internet connection, but it's optional.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="policy-section">
          <h2>App Blocking</h2>
          <p><strong>How do I choose which apps get blocked?</strong></p>
          <p>Go to Settings → App Blocking → Choose Apps. You'll see Apple's built-in app picker where you can select specific apps or entire categories. Your selection is saved and used every workout.</p>

          <p><strong>Can I disable blocking anytime?</strong></p>
          <p>Yes. You can use the emergency unlock button during a workout, toggle blocking off in Settings, or simply end your workout to remove all shields immediately.</p>

          <p><strong>Why isn't app blocking working?</strong></p>
          <p>Make sure you've granted Screen Time permission in Settings → App Blocking, and that at least one app is selected to block. If it still doesn't work, try toggling the "App Blocking" switch off and on in Settings.</p>

          <p><strong>Is SetLock a parental control app?</strong></p>
          <p>No. SetLock is for individuals managing their own focus. It uses Apple's "Individual" authorization mode — you control your own device only.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="policy-section">
          <h2>Apple Watch</h2>
          <p><strong>What happens if my phone isn't nearby?</strong></p>
          <p>The Watch app runs the timer independently. App blocking commands are queued and delivered to your iPhone when it's reachable again. Your workout data syncs automatically.</p>

          <p><strong>The Watch app isn't syncing with my iPhone. What do I do?</strong></p>
          <p>Try force-quitting and reopening SetLock on both devices. Make sure Bluetooth is enabled and both devices are signed in to the same Apple ID. If the issue persists, email us with your device details.</p>

          <p><strong>How do I install the Watch app?</strong></p>
          <p>If "Automatic App Install" is enabled on your Watch (Watch app → General → App Install), the SetLock Watch app installs automatically. Otherwise, open the App Store on your Apple Watch and search for SetLock.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="policy-section">
          <h2>Account & Data</h2>
          <p><strong>Do I need an account?</strong></p>
          <p>No. SetLock works fully in guest mode — your workout data is stored locally on your device. Sign in with Apple or email only if you want to sync your history across multiple devices.</p>

          <p><strong>How do I delete my account and data?</strong></p>
          <p>Go to Settings → Account → Delete Account. This removes all cloud data permanently. Local data is cleared when you delete the app.</p>

          <p><strong>Does SetLock read my messages or browsing history?</strong></p>
          <p>No. SetLock only uses Apple's Screen Time APIs to temporarily block apps you select. We cannot and do not read your messages, browsing history, or any content within apps.</p>
